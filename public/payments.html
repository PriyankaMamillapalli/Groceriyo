   <p>Finding a payment processing solution can be challenging for a supermarket,
             especially one that hasn’t moved from a traditional model. <br>Software developers
              and independent software vendors (ISVs) can help a business move into the 
              twenty-first century,<br> given the right tools.  However, these professionals are
               only as good as the tools they have access to, and a grocery or supermarket 
               needs <br> to make the best choice when it comes  to their current payment processing
                service. This paper will explore the challenges that vendors <br> in the supermarket
                 industry typically face and explore how they can overcome them with payment 
                 technology.
         Entering a<br> grocery store in a pandemic with such a contagious disease as COVID-19 
            
        means coming into contact with other people. <br>Even payment methods such as swiping a
         card or passing cash to someone could potentially lead to the disease’s spread. <br>
         That’s why customers are increasingly turning to new shopping platforms and methods
          to order groceries safely.<br> In fact, Mastercard found that more than half of grocery
           store shoppers opted for contactless payments if they had<br> the option since it was
            safer and exposed them to germs much less than the transfer of money or a card.<br>
             The onus is on supermarkets and grocers to provide the infrastructure to enable
              contactless payments.<br>
            Online payments are slightly different. While the customer can still use their 
            credit and debit card for payments,<br> they may need to be routed through a payment
             gateway. Businesses can get software developers to tie their online payments <br>
             system to the payment gateway, limiting where the client has to go to complete
              payments. Master processing accounts<br> can even be linked between POS kiosks and
               online payment systems, allowing customers to access their rewards for points<br>
                from their online purchases. 
     
            The Credit Card/Debit Card details provided to The Organic Garden.        <br>
            by the customer will not be shared with any third party. In the case of 
            fraudulent matters, the company holds the right to        <br>share the details with 
            the concerned body for verification. The customer shall not under any circumstance
             use a credit/debit card.<br> that is not lawfully owned by him.
