             <p> Once you place your order, our shoppers team starts collecting your items. 
                 We will note any <br>items you order from our perishable departments, and send 
                 those orders to our different department heads.<br> A produce manager will 
                 select your produce, your meat will be cut fresh by the butcher that morning,<br>
                  and your deli order will be filled right before delivery. We pride ourselves 
                  on the freshest products at competitive prices.<br>No boxes, paper or plastic bags to deal with
                  We bring your order in special packs that keep items safe and cool,<br> without excess packaging. You get exactly what you ordered, but nothing to clean up.
                  You pay the same,<br> low prices you enjoy at your local Walmart grocery, every day of the week.
